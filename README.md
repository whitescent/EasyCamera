# EasyCamera


## What's this?

This is an app that simply displays the phone's camera screen to the screen, and can be used with [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) to display the screen in OBS Studio

OBS Studio: Add Game Capture -> scrcpy.exe, note that if you add window capture, you will encounter the situation that the screen does not move.
